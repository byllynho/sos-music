There I was
Waiting for a chance
Hoping that you'll understand
The things I wanna say
As my love went stronger than before
I wanna see you more and more
But you closed your door
Why don't you try
To open up your heart
I won't take so much of your time
Maybe, it's wrong to say please love me too
'Cause I know you'll never do
Somebody else is waiting there inside for you
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day
'Cause I know he's here to stay
But I know to whom you should belong
I believed what you said to me
We should set each other free
That's how you want it to be

14,"You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Well it's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes

And know a mother's love

Take a deep breath, do the opposite of what you wanna do
Make him wait, by the phone
At the door to meet your dad.
Before that first kiss, he's gotta hold your hand
You can't get it back when you give yourself away
Yeah boys gonna run but a real man's gonna stay.
Girl, make him wait
Mmhmmmm, make him wait.
And when he says that, it'd be easier if you just stayed the night
Make him wait. (Mmhmmmm).
Your gonna wanna, if you think you just might
Make him wait, oooohhhh
Make him wait, by the phone
At the door to meet your dad.
Before that first kiss, he's gotta hold your hand.
You can't get it back when you give yourself away
Yeah boys gonna run but a real man's gonna stay
Girl, Make him wait
Oohhhhh, make him wait.
They taught me that love is worth the weight in gold
Like that ring on your hand, so
When you find the one that stays and calls
Then he won't mind
If you make him wait, in his Tux
Cellos sing you down the aisle
Walk slow, take your time
While your daddy cries, and your momma smiles
And they're throwin' rice into the air
And those tin cans roll away
And you look into his eyes, and realize
it's worth the while
to make him wait
Make him wait.

18,"Many, many years ago when I was 23
I was married to a widow who was pretty as can be
This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red
My father fell in love with her and soon they too were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law and really changed my life
For now my daughter was my mother 'cause she was my father's wife
And to complicate the matter even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so he became my uncle though it mad me very sad
For if he were my uncle that would also made him brother
Of the widows grown-up daughter who was of course my stepmother
Father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild for he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue
Because although she is my wife she's my grandmother two
Now if my wife is my grandmother then I'm her grandchild
And every time I think of it, nearly drives me wild

You weren't your momma's only boy, but her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know on the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dyin words, ah but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say, they could've had him any day
They only let him slip away, out of kindness I suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues all night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go, there ain't nobody knows
All the Federales say, they could've had him any day
They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose
The boys tell how old Pancho fell, and Lefty's livin in cheap hotels

And so the story ends we're told

When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
-----
Version 2
I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore
Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see
Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day long
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on
I should care if the wind blows east or west
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
I should smile, that's exactly what I do

There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew

Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Smile even tho' it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
Thro' your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow

Light up your face with gladness
Hide ev-'ry trace of sadness

You'll find that life is still worth-while

Now, when she's talking to you
Make sure you listen close
'Cause she's gonna teach you everything
You'll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners
To love and laugh and dream
And she'll put you on the path
That'll bring you back to Me
So, hush now little baby don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making sure you're always gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender, tough and strong
Come on child
It's time to meet your mom

In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.
My Daddy worked all night in the Vanleer coal mines
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain there was no need
She'd smile in Mommy's understanding way.
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from sellin' a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well - the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we worked hard
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.
Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the mem'ries of a coal miner's daughter.

And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book, and I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then
I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Shu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denyin'
And he said some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'
Like tomorrow was the end
And ya got eternity to think about what to do with it
What should you do with it
What can I do with it
What would I do with it

Well you know I'm just havin' fun
But seriously
You'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You be my sugar baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothin' left to do but fall in each other's arms
I could've said a I love you
Could've wrote you a line or two
Baby all I know to do
Is speak right from the heart
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
You'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta

90,"He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.
Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.
I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.
(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.
(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...
(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th I went to see my

Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried making good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle

Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away
Cause now im knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change you're geography
Maybe you might be
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Come on in the water it's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise

Aolong with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain some time

But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly

Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain some time
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out

I just want to thank You, Lord, for every time You heard me pray

Well when I was kid I'd take a trip
every summer,
down to Mississippi.
To visit my granny in her ante bellum world.
I'd run barefooted all day long,
climbing trees free as a song.
One day I happened catch myself a squirrel.
I stuffed him down in an old shoebox,
punched a couple holes in the top and when Sunday came,
I snuck him into church.
I was sittin way back in the very last pew
showin him to my good buddy Hugh,
when that squirrel got loose
and went totally berserk!
Well what happened next is hard to tell.
Some thought it was Heaven others thought it was Hell.
But the fact that something was among us
was plain to see.
As the choir sang I Surrender All
the squirrel ran up Harv Newlan's coveralls
Harv leaped to his feet and said,
Somethin's got a hold on me! YEOW!
Chorus
The day the squirrel went berserk,
In the First Self-Righteous Church
in that sleepy little town of Pascagoula.
It was a fight for survival,
that broke out in revival.
They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah!
Verse 2
Well, Harv hit the aisles dancin' and screamin'
Some thought he had religion
Others thought he had a demon
And Harv thought he had a weed eater loose in his Fruit-Of-The-Looms
He fell to his knees to plead and beg
And the squirrel ran out of his britches leg,
Unobserved, to the other side of the room
All the way down to the amen pew,
Where sat Sister Bertha better-than-you,
Who'd been watchin' all the commotion with sadistic glee
But you should've seen the look in her eyes
When that squirrel jumped her garters and crossed her thighs
She jumped to her feet and said Lord have mercy on me
As the squirrel made laps inside her dress
She began to cry and then to confess to sins that would make a sailor blush with shame
She told of gossip and church dissension but the thing that got the most attention
Was when she talked about her love life
And then she started naming names!

Well seven deacons and then the pastor got saved
and 25, 000 dollars got raised.
And 50 volunteered for missions in the Congo on the spot.
and even without an invitation
there were at least 500 rededications.
And we all got re-baptized whether we needed it or not.
Now you've heard the Bible stories I guess
of how He parted the waters for Moses to pass.

But the one I'll remember to my dyin day
is how he put that church back on the narrow way

Tryna drink you up
Tryna take you home

Can take your sun
And turn it ice cold

Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn't change ya
I'd just paint you bright

Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushin' through

Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

134,"After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone there's no denying
You'll feel blue you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time, when you'll regret it
Some day when you'll grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine
And you'll want me only
After you've gone after you've gone away
After I'm gone, after we break up
After I'm gone, you're gonna wake up
You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
After the years we've been together
Thought joy and tears all kind of weather
Someday blue and downhearted
You'll long to be with me right back where you started
After I'm gone after I'm gone away

You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
Someday blue and downhearted
You'll long to be with me right back where you started
After I'm gone after I'm gone away
You'll feel blue and you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you ever had
Someday when you've grown lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone after you've gone away
You made me sad and blue but now I'm through with you
And there's nothing more you can say

I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition
So don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Stop and think it over,
Try and put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, its a family tradition!

I have heard You calling in the night.
I will go Lord, if You lead me.
I will hold Your people in my heart.
I, the Lord of snow and rain,
I have born my peoples pain.
I have wept for love of them, They turn away.
I will break their hearts of stone,
Give them hearts for love alone.
I will speak My word to them,
Whom shall I send?
Here I am Lord, Is it I Lord?
I have heard You calling in the night.
I will go Lord, if You lead me.
I will hold Your people in my heart.
I, the Lord of wind and flame,
I will tend the poor and lame.
I will set a feast for them,
My hand will save
Finest bread I will provide,
Till their hearts be satisfied.
I will give My life to them,
Whom shall I send?

I had a crush on my teacher
